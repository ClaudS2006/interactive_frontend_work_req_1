## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have a solid understanding of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
Preferebly worked with an Editor like VS Code or Phoenix beforehand and have 
basic knowledge about working with the terminal (build-in in VS Code).

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

#### 1. Node.js
This project requires Node.js version 18 or higher.  
Download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installer instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

To check your installation, run:
```bash
node -v (It should print a version >= 18)
```

#### 2. npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

- npm comes automatically with Node.js
- Check your version in the terminal:
```bash
npm -v
```
Yarn is an alternative package manager. To install it globally:
npm install -g yarn (in terminal)

#### 3. Vite + React + TypeScript Setup

To create a new project with Vite:

npm create vite@latest my-project (creates new project folder)
# or 
npm create vite@latest . (if you already have an empty folder & want to start from there)
# or
yarn create vite@latest my-project

# During the setup, you'll be asked to select a framework and variant (navigate with arrow-keys ‚¨Ü‚¨á):

Framework: select React
Variant: select TypeScript

# install dependencies in terminal:

you will be prompted to run:
**npm install** (to install dependencies) with Node or 
**yarn** (for yarn)
followed by:
**npm run dev** to start the development server or
**yarn dev** (for yarn)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
