## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have a solid understanding of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
Preferably worked with an Editor like VS Code or Phoenix beforehand and have
basic knowledge about working with the terminal (built-in in VS Code).

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

#### 1. Node.js

This project requires Node.js version 18 or higher.  
Download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installer instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

To check your installation, run:

```bash
node -v 
```
It should print a version >= 18

#### 2. npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

- npm comes automatically with Node.js
- Check your version in the terminal:

```bash
npm -v
```

Yarn is an alternative package manager. To install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### 3. Vite + React + TypeScript Setup

To create a new project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-project 
```
creates new project folder
### or

```bash
npm create vite@latest . 
```
If you already have an empty folder & want to start from there.
### or

```bash
yarn create vite@latest my-project
```

## During the setup, you'll be asked to select a framework and variant (navigate with arrow-keys ‚¨Ü‚¨á):

**Framework**: select React <br>
**Variant**: select TypeScript <br>


# Install dependencies in terminal:

You will be prompted to run:

```bash
npm install 
```
